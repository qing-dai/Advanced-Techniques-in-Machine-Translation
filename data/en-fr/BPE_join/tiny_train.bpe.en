today is a new day !
I want you to get started right away .
do you see the six windows on the fac@@ ade ?
one should be @@UNKNOWN@@ ct@@ ful of other &apos;s @@UNKNOWN@@ fs rather than mo@@ ck them .
people usually die if you kill them .
it was working .
Tom needs us to show him the way .
just do your job .
the train was about to leave the station .
here is an atomic power plant .
when the al@@ arm clock goes off , I don &apos;t move .
this feels like sil@@ k .
a traffic accident happened there .
Tom didn &apos;t do that very much .
Tom had just one word to cut so that out of this sentence , forever , disappeared our Mary .
we im@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ coffee from Brazil .
but you cannot understand . how could you understand what it is to feel old ?
why do I believe you ?
you spread your affairs too th@@ in .
those box @@UNKNOWN@@ kers have a good re@@ ver@@ b .
they were hanging on her words .
instead of complaining , maybe you should help .
I think we can handle that .
I am deeply interested in art .
you are old enough to know this .
I accepted his inv@@ itation .
I &apos;d like to hear you sing your new song .
the children are going to the beach today .
can you believe this is really happening ?
he paid the loan with interest .
I know you like chocolate .
I never meant for any of this to happen .
the de@@ er was running by itself .
for him , divorce is a good invention , with one so@@ le disa@@ d@@ v@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ : you have to get married first .
the bi@@ par@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ an com@@ mission &apos;s @@UNKNOWN@@ en@@ da@@ tions were ignored .
I wasn &apos;t told where we were going .
that &apos;s @@UNKNOWN@@ t@@ ful .
she intended to become an ac@@ tre@@ ss .
he is always expres@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ less .
he has travel@@ ed around the world in eighty days by himself .
blame it on the weather .
I can explain it to you , but I can &apos;t understand it for you !
shame on you for your dis@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ ement !
he left the room without saying a word .
I &apos;d like to get medi@@ cal insurance .
he went down the hill .
the girls gi@@ gg@@ led .
is anybody there ?
I &apos;m not scared of women .
the angry mo@@ b over@@ turned cars and smashed sto@@ re@@ front windows .
I resi@@ g@@ n .
I know he is busy .
the man and his horse that fell off the cli@@ ff were soon rescued .
she is very c@@ un@@ ning .
it was a compromise .
he is ap@@ t to forget .
a bird in the hand is better than two in the bush .
if you &apos;re busy , I &apos;ll help you .
turn right at the next inter@@ section .
you look busy .
they all laughed at their error .
Tom didn &apos;t eat the apple you gave him .
birds have ne@@ sts , @@UNKNOWN@@ ders have we@@ bs , and @@UNKNOWN@@ ans have friendship .
ten years have gone by .
I &apos;m trapped .
Marie re@@ lu@@ ct@@ an@@ tly takes another piece of cake .
I left behind some important docu@@ ments for the company at home . sorry , but could you please go and get them for me now ?
&quot; listen to me , &quot; said the De@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ , @@UNKNOWN@@ ing his hand upon my head .
you should have stopped .
he sp@@ rained his an@@ k@@ le .
Tom looks older than he really is .
I was watching the scene hol@@ ding my breath .
Mary got to know her boyfriend in Paris .
hand in your p@@ ap@@ ers .
are you still married ?
you must pay in advance .
in K@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ lia , we speak the K@@ ab@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ language .
she turned a page of her book .
yes , you should wear red li@@ p@@ stick for V@@ al@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ ine &apos;s day .
Tom isn &apos;t invited to parties often .
you see the words that I ty@@ ped on the @@UNKNOWN@@ en , but you don &apos;t see the tears that I shed over the ke@@ y@@ board .
give me a ti@@ p .
what do you want to drink with your meal ?
she lives near the beach .
I want to live in a castle .
don &apos;t you see the pat@@ ter@@ n ?
I don &apos;t date .
be @@UNKNOWN@@ ct@@ ful .
he can swim fast .
he saw a pretty girl .
the windows were open .
Tom wanted to go home early .
I forgot my de@@ bit card at home .
you &apos;re tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thy .
Mary threw a pot@@ a@@ to through the window .
everyone deserves a second chance .
I find that it &apos;s best to find a happy bal@@ ance between @@UNKNOWN@@ ality and st@@ ic@@ king to a stri@@ ct @@UNKNOWN@@ ard .
I remember meeting her somewhere .
I &apos;m br@@ in@@ ging home a pizza .
here is where it all happens .
soon your efforts will be rewar@@ ded .
is the coffee hot ?
thanks for jo@@ ining us .
it &apos;s a p@@ ity that you can &apos;t travel with us .
I wonder what happened to Paul .
you know where to find me if you need anything .
no one knows his name .
I &apos;m on to you .
it &apos;s blowing very hard .
I didn &apos;t know you were still here .
we talked about everything we could think about .
I don &apos;t have much time .
don &apos;t you feel stupid now ?
Tom &apos;s phone can take pictures .
what do you want the message to be ?
mom said I caught a cold because I went out with wet hair .
how many more for@@ ks do you need ?
rarely have I met such a gr@@ ac@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ d@@ anc@@ er .
I &apos;ve missed another chance .
I don &apos;t know how to con@@ tact you .
do you want to join me for lunch ?
all of these letters are addressed to you .
Tom knew where he had put his keys .
you could count to ten when you were two .
I just found it .
Tom is laughing .
do you know what day it is today ?
the poor cat was run over by a truck .
I don &apos;t want to get involved in that business .
there isn &apos;t any problem at all .
I was over@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ el@@ med .
the boy was clever enough to solve the puzzle .
I live with a por@@ cu@@ p@@ ine .
I appreciate your work .
the system is ri@@ gg@@ ed .
an artist must have an eye for col@@ our .
Oh @@UNKNOWN@@ w ! what &apos;s this , you &apos;re having lunch without me !
you sound tired .
maybe Tom is in love .
look at the meter .
Thomas changed into proper @@UNKNOWN@@ thing .
my mother bought two bottles of orange ju@@ ice .
taking everything into consi@@ der@@ ation , the result is better than I expected .
I guess right nine times out of ten .
that &apos;s a nice pair of legs .
it is by this reason that he left school .
&quot; have you finished ? &quot; &quot; on the contrary . I haven &apos;t even started . &quot;
he doesn &apos;t like beef . neither do I .
where did you go to school ?
please don &apos;t di@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ me from my work .
by teaching , we learn .
I tell you a little secret .
I &apos;m not scared at all .
he was ac@@ comp@@ ani@@ ed by his girlfriend .
his office is near the train station .
Tom was sitting under a tree , drinking wine .
I &apos;ve been hoping to meet you .
don &apos;t work too hard !
can you wash my jeans ?
do you speak @@UNKNOWN@@ t@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ ?
I &apos;m as curious as you are .
Oh , how we laughed !
what &apos;s your @@UNKNOWN@@ pa@@ tion ?
that picture does not do justice to him .
don &apos;t cut in while we &apos;re talking .
it &apos;s because I was asked to come that I &apos;m here .
I really wish I could go with you , but I can &apos;t .
he is wise who neither ho@@ pes nor f@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ anything from the un@@ certain future .
our class has twenty @-@ five boys and twenty girls .
go away before they see you here .
I &apos;m with them now .
once I re@@ tire , I will de@@ dic@@ ate my whole time to Tatoeba .
it &apos;s mer@@ ely a joke .
I do not have a sister .
S@@ am is two years younger than Tom .
may I borrow your bike ?
what does your father like ?
what a cat@@ a@@ stro@@ p@@ he !
for the shar@@ ks , we saw them , not by un@@ its , nor by ten@@ s , nor by hun@@ dre@@ ds ; but by thousands and by @@UNKNOWN@@ ri@@ a@@ ds . trust me , there are more shar@@ ks in the sea than mor@@ tal@@ s on land .
you should get up early .
love is @@UNKNOWN@@ fied of everything that is not itself .
he &apos;ll be back in ten .
if I wanted to s@@ care you , I would have told you about what I drea@@ m@@ t about a few weeks ago .
you &apos;re not dead yet .
I know a good restaurant that &apos;s in@@ expensive .
who is the person in charge ?
trying to find happiness only makes you un@@ happy .
I want to speak to a lawyer .
he a@@ ven@@ ged his dead father .
she liked that .
I &apos;m sor@@ e all over .
why don &apos;t you sit down ?
stop sho@@ wing off !
the weather is very cold in I@@ stan@@ bu@@ l .
I &apos;m doing you a favor .
you were afraid , weren &apos;t you ?
I don &apos;t like the taste of on@@ ions .
they never returned to their country .
when do you mean to start ?
why do the stars tw@@ in@@ k@@ le ?
when I came home , he was watching TV .
she nam@@ ed him Charles .
she @@UNKNOWN@@ better than him .
I made a proposal .
what do you plan on doing tonight ?
I &apos;m afraid you can &apos;t do that .
there is milk in the re@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ ator .
I don &apos;t know her address .
I don &apos;t blame you for doing that .
I have a friend who lives in Kyoto .
I think you &apos;re too pick@@ y .
I opened the window to let in some fresh air .
I could not stop laughing .
press any key to contin@@ ue .
I &apos;m not rac@@ ist .
the fire , dri@@ ven by an e@@ ast wind , destro@@ yed the center of the city .
you look @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ .
sorry to have kept you waiting so long .
of course I &apos;ll go .
this mountain is difficult to climb .
we needed this .
can you think of a better way ?
you &apos;ve run out of things to drink .
call me if you want to do something together tomorrow .
at what time are we going to get a bite to eat , with all that ?
who &apos;s your most interesting friend ?
be n@@ ic@@ er to your brother .
get the hell out of here !
I wasn &apos;t told that .
she broke the cup , too .
one day he was walking along the street .
we &apos;ll see each other again someday .
they hid in the @@UNKNOWN@@ lar .
I &apos;m a d@@ anc@@ er .
my father was a teacher .
I &apos;m starting to feel des@@ perate .
the concert was a success .
let &apos;s contin@@ ue where we left off yesterday .
I believe that this is not a good idea .
you were @@UNKNOWN@@ fied , weren &apos;t you ?
finally he invited all and sun@@ dry to par@@ take of the cake and all .
is this lake deep ?
sea tur@@ t@@ les don &apos;t have teeth .

are you from around here ?
where do you live ?
no gift is more precious than trust .
you don &apos;t have to answer .
T@@ rang asked if she could share my bed .
my watch ran down and I didn &apos;t know the time .
they gre@@ e@@ ted me .
I would like to kiss you .
have fun .
are you in love with Layla ?
he had a gen@@ t@@ len@@ ess that was attr@@ active to women .
charge !
he likes tea .
whose friend is he ?
this morning I missed the 8 : 30 train by five minutes .
this li@@ d is too tight for me to open .
I have to go back to work .
Mike and Ken are friends .
you don &apos;t sound too sure .
ain &apos;t that cute ?
they collected sh@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ on the beach .
what exactly did you say ?
he set off to Paris .
the me@@ s@@ sen@@ ger left for London in secret .
there &apos;s no way I &apos;m going to work on Sunday .
it &apos;s hard for an old man to change his way of living .
air is a mi@@ x@@ ture of various @@UNKNOWN@@ es .
Mis@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ and@@ ings do occur .
are you going to be OK ?
what &apos;s going on with you ? you haven &apos;t been talking to me for a while now .
you don &apos;t know anything about I@@ stan@@ bu@@ l .
she only worked for the sake of money .
I don &apos;t want to talk about this anymore .
K@@ it@@ ty the cat gets in the car to go for a ride .
does this story hold water ?
M@@ ic@@ ha@@ el Jack@@ son died .

these problems will be solved in the near future .
Sami &apos;s plane crashed in the field .
he doesn &apos;t want to talk about it .
I &apos;m all set .
my computer won &apos;t start any more .
I &apos;ve been in Boston for less than a month .
Tom didn &apos;t tell me he couldn &apos;t speak French .
did you find the difference between these two photos ?

I told you that was ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous .
what was the color of the apple he gave you ?
they @@UNKNOWN@@ ved , even though the building was destro@@ yed .

my heart was p@@ oun@@ ding as my turn got @@UNKNOWN@@ er .
that &apos;s not fair ! you saw my cards in the m@@ ir@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ !
she was so beautiful that the mer@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ &apos;s son could not help k@@ ne@@ el@@ ing down to kiss her hand .

I want to go there once again .
I &apos;m beginning to get used to doing this .
he wrote a book about his @@UNKNOWN@@ sion to I@@ sla@@ m .
I found it in the at@@ tic .
I don &apos;t know how to con@@ tact you .
I invited her to a movie .
Tom says it as it is .
I &apos;m sure you &apos;ll tell me what I want to know .
how is the weather there ?
a ma@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ truth is neither simple nor complicated ; it is .
he is studying history at the university .
he is such a show off .
can I think about it ?
this is the fin@@ al strugg@@ le .
they &apos;re very smart .
you accused him of having stolen the bike .
why don &apos;t we talk for a while ?
I helped my parents with the hou@@ se@@ work .
he knows Mr. D@@ a@@ vi@@ d@@ son well .
get back to where you started .
that is of no use to me .
get me all the information you can on this matter .
I went to Boston by train .
maybe Tom should pay more attention in class .
you were sleeping , weren &apos;t you ?
there are no d@@ ru@@ gs here .

they &apos;ve crossed the border .
give me the @@UNKNOWN@@ ro@@ phone .

Tom drank straight from the bottle .
start at once , or you will be late .
I ordered you a drink .
they have gone far away .
he probably didn &apos;t have sex with her .
please call him up .
Hey , your dog just bit me .
I especially like your chocolate cake .
Tom is the tallest guy I &apos;ve ever seen .
you should not go alone .
that &apos;s your duty .
the doctor advised that she take a holiday .
I &apos;ve been so@@ ber for three years .

I &apos;d like to tell you something in private .
do not inter@@ f@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ !
he took her in his arms .
you are lying .

where do you want to eat ?
if I knew how to use a computer , maybe they would pay me more .
beautiful bird !
you can &apos;t do both at the same time .
I had to make a choice .

this is not good at all .
your garden needs some attention .
he felt in his pocket for his ligh@@ ter .
what &apos;re you doing today ?

I was hoping that you &apos;d know the answer .
Sami is a compu@@ l@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ liar .
he wants to kill me .
the baby is sleeping .
what do you like about her ?
I &apos;m not here to buy shoes .

everyone looked relieved .
S@@ tre@@ t@@ ch your arms straight .

there &apos;s nothing up here .
how is the word @@UNKNOWN@@ oun@@ ced ?
our cat is @@UNKNOWN@@ i@@ li@@ zed .
I know that Tom isn &apos;t rich .
something tells me that you &apos;re hiding something .
she made me wait for half an hour .
you gave me your word .
they began this year .
what &apos;s the worst tattoo you &apos;ve ever seen ?
can I get something to eat ?
you can &apos;t complain .
