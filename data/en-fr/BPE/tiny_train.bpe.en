today is a new day !
I want you to get started right away .
do you see the six windows on the fac@@ ade ?
one should be respe@@ ct@@ ful of other &apos;s belie@@ fs rather than mo@@ ck them .
people usually die if you kill them .
it was working .
Tom needs us to show him the way .
just do your job .
the train was about to leave the station .
here is an atomic power plant .
when the al@@ arm clock goes off , I don &apos;t move .
this feels like sil@@ k .
a traffic accident happened there .
Tom didn &apos;t do that very much .
Tom had just one word to cut so that out of this sentence , forever , disappeared our Mary .
we im@@ port coffee from Brazil .
but you cannot understand . how could you understand what it is to feel old ?
why do I believe you ?
you spread your affairs too th@@ in .
those box spea@@ kers have a good re@@ ver@@ b .
they were hanging on her words .
instead of complaining , maybe you should help .
I think we can handle that .
I am deeply interested in art .
you are old enough to know this .
I accepted his inv@@ itation .
I &apos;d like to hear you sing your new song .
the children are going to the beach today .
can you believe this is really happening ?
he paid the loan with interest .
I know you like chocolate .
I never meant for any of this to happen .
the de@@ er was running by itself .
for him , divorce is a good invention , with one so@@ le disa@@ d@@ v@@ antage : you have to get married first .
the bi@@ par@@ tis@@ an com@@ mission &apos;s recomm@@ en@@ da@@ tions were ignored .
I wasn &apos;t told where we were going .
that &apos;s doub@@ t@@ ful .
she intended to become an ac@@ tre@@ ss .
he is always expres@@ sion@@ less .
he has travel@@ ed around the world in eighty days by himself .
blame it on the weather .
I can explain it to you , but I can &apos;t understand it for you !
shame on you for your dis@@ courag@@ ement !
he left the room without saying a word .
I &apos;d like to get medi@@ cal insurance .
he went down the hill .
the girls gi@@ gg@@ led .
is anybody there ?
I &apos;m not scared of women .
the angry mo@@ b over@@ turned cars and smashed sto@@ re@@ front windows .
I resi@@ g@@ n .
I know he is busy .
the man and his horse that fell off the cli@@ ff were soon rescued .
she is very c@@ un@@ ning .
it was a compromise .
he is ap@@ t to forget .
a bird in the hand is better than two in the bush .
if you &apos;re busy , I &apos;ll help you .
turn right at the next inter@@ section .
you look busy .
they all laughed at their error .
Tom didn &apos;t eat the apple you gave him .
birds have ne@@ sts , spi@@ ders have we@@ bs , and hum@@ ans have friendship .
ten years have gone by .
I &apos;m trapped .
Marie re@@ lu@@ ct@@ an@@ tly takes another piece of cake .
I left behind some important docu@@ ments for the company at home . sorry , but could you please go and get them for me now ?
&quot; listen to me , &quot; said the De@@ m@@ on , plac@@ ing his hand upon my head .
you should have stopped .
he sp@@ rained his an@@ k@@ le .
Tom looks older than he really is .
I was watching the scene hol@@ ding my breath .
Mary got to know her boyfriend in Paris .
hand in your p@@ ap@@ ers .
are you still married ?
you must pay in advance .
in K@@ ab@@ y@@ lia , we speak the K@@ ab@@ yle language .
she turned a page of her book .
yes , you should wear red li@@ p@@ stick for V@@ al@@ en@@ t@@ ine &apos;s day .
Tom isn &apos;t invited to parties often .
you see the words that I ty@@ ped on the scre@@ en , but you don &apos;t see the tears that I shed over the ke@@ y@@ board .
give me a ti@@ p .
what do you want to drink with your meal ?
she lives near the beach .
I want to live in a castle .
don &apos;t you see the pat@@ ter@@ n ?
I don &apos;t date .
be respe@@ ct@@ ful .
he can swim fast .
he saw a pretty girl .
the windows were open .
Tom wanted to go home early .
I forgot my de@@ bit card at home .
you &apos;re tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thy .
Mary threw a pot@@ a@@ to through the window .
everyone deserves a second chance .
I find that it &apos;s best to find a happy bal@@ ance between origin@@ ality and st@@ ic@@ king to a stri@@ ct stand@@ ard .
I remember meeting her somewhere .
I &apos;m br@@ in@@ ging home a pizza .
here is where it all happens .
soon your efforts will be rewar@@ ded .
is the coffee hot ?
thanks for jo@@ ining us .
it &apos;s a p@@ ity that you can &apos;t travel with us .
I wonder what happened to Paul .
you know where to find me if you need anything .
no one knows his name .
I &apos;m on to you .
it &apos;s blowing very hard .
I didn &apos;t know you were still here .
we talked about everything we could think about .
I don &apos;t have much time .
don &apos;t you feel stupid now ?
Tom &apos;s phone can take pictures .
what do you want the message to be ?
mom said I caught a cold because I went out with wet hair .
how many more for@@ ks do you need ?
rarely have I met such a gr@@ ac@@ eful d@@ anc@@ er .
I &apos;ve missed another chance .
I don &apos;t know how to con@@ tact you .
do you want to join me for lunch ?
all of these letters are addressed to you .
Tom knew where he had put his keys .
you could count to ten when you were two .
I just found it .
Tom is laughing .
do you know what day it is today ?
the poor cat was run over by a truck .
I don &apos;t want to get involved in that business .
there isn &apos;t any problem at all .
I was over@@ wh@@ el@@ med .
the boy was clever enough to solve the puzzle .
I live with a por@@ cu@@ p@@ ine .
I appreciate your work .
the system is ri@@ gg@@ ed .
an artist must have an eye for col@@ our .
Oh wo@@ w ! what &apos;s this , you &apos;re having lunch without me !
you sound tired .
maybe Tom is in love .
look at the meter .
Thomas changed into proper clo@@ thing .
my mother bought two bottles of orange ju@@ ice .
taking everything into consi@@ der@@ ation , the result is better than I expected .
I guess right nine times out of ten .
that &apos;s a nice pair of legs .
it is by this reason that he left school .
&quot; have you finished ? &quot; &quot; on the contrary . I haven &apos;t even started . &quot;
he doesn &apos;t like beef . neither do I .
where did you go to school ?
please don &apos;t di@@ stract me from my work .
by teaching , we learn .
I tell you a little secret .
I &apos;m not scared at all .
he was ac@@ comp@@ ani@@ ed by his girlfriend .
his office is near the train station .
Tom was sitting under a tree , drinking wine .
I &apos;ve been hoping to meet you .
don &apos;t work too hard !
can you wash my jeans ?
do you speak M@@ al@@ t@@ ese ?
I &apos;m as curious as you are .
Oh , how we laughed !
what &apos;s your occu@@ pa@@ tion ?
that picture does not do justice to him .
don &apos;t cut in while we &apos;re talking .
it &apos;s because I was asked to come that I &apos;m here .
I really wish I could go with you , but I can &apos;t .
he is wise who neither ho@@ pes nor f@@ ears anything from the un@@ certain future .
our class has twenty @-@ five boys and twenty girls .
go away before they see you here .
I &apos;m with them now .
once I re@@ tire , I will de@@ dic@@ ate my whole time to Tatoeba .
it &apos;s mer@@ ely a joke .
I do not have a sister .
S@@ am is two years younger than Tom .
may I borrow your bike ?
what does your father like ?
what a cat@@ a@@ stro@@ p@@ he !
for the shar@@ ks , we saw them , not by un@@ its , nor by ten@@ s , nor by hun@@ dre@@ ds ; but by thousands and by my@@ ri@@ a@@ ds . trust me , there are more shar@@ ks in the sea than mor@@ tal@@ s on land .
you should get up early .
love is terri@@ fied of everything that is not itself .
he &apos;ll be back in ten .
if I wanted to s@@ care you , I would have told you about what I drea@@ m@@ t about a few weeks ago .
you &apos;re not dead yet .
I know a good restaurant that &apos;s in@@ expensive .
who is the person in charge ?
trying to find happiness only makes you un@@ happy .
I want to speak to a lawyer .
he a@@ ven@@ ged his dead father .
she liked that .
I &apos;m sor@@ e all over .
why don &apos;t you sit down ?
stop sho@@ wing off !
the weather is very cold in I@@ stan@@ bu@@ l .
I &apos;m doing you a favor .
you were afraid , weren &apos;t you ?
I don &apos;t like the taste of on@@ ions .
they never returned to their country .
when do you mean to start ?
why do the stars tw@@ in@@ k@@ le ?
when I came home , he was watching TV .
she nam@@ ed him Charles .
she s@@ an@@ g better than him .
I made a proposal .
what do you plan on doing tonight ?
I &apos;m afraid you can &apos;t do that .
there is milk in the re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ator .
I don &apos;t know her address .
I don &apos;t blame you for doing that .
I have a friend who lives in Kyoto .
I think you &apos;re too pick@@ y .
I opened the window to let in some fresh air .
I could not stop laughing .
press any key to contin@@ ue .
I &apos;m not rac@@ ist .
the fire , dri@@ ven by an e@@ ast wind , destro@@ yed the center of the city .
you look terri@@ fic .
sorry to have kept you waiting so long .
of course I &apos;ll go .
this mountain is difficult to climb .
we needed this .
can you think of a better way ?
you &apos;ve run out of things to drink .
call me if you want to do something together tomorrow .
at what time are we going to get a bite to eat , with all that ?
who &apos;s your most interesting friend ?
be n@@ ic@@ er to your brother .
get the hell out of here !
I wasn &apos;t told that .
she broke the cup , too .
one day he was walking along the street .
we &apos;ll see each other again someday .
they hid in the c@@ el@@ lar .
I &apos;m a d@@ anc@@ er .
my father was a teacher .
I &apos;m starting to feel des@@ perate .
the concert was a success .
let &apos;s contin@@ ue where we left off yesterday .
I believe that this is not a good idea .
you were terri@@ fied , weren &apos;t you ?
finally he invited all and sun@@ dry to par@@ take of the cake and all .
is this lake deep ?
sea tur@@ t@@ les don &apos;t have teeth .
how are you taking it ?
we live together .
did it snow yesterday ?
are you from around here ?
where do you live ?
no gift is more precious than trust .
you don &apos;t have to answer .
T@@ rang asked if she could share my bed .
my watch ran down and I didn &apos;t know the time .
they gre@@ e@@ ted me .
I would like to kiss you .
have fun .
are you in love with Layla ?
he had a gen@@ t@@ len@@ ess that was attr@@ active to women .
charge !
he likes tea .
whose friend is he ?
this morning I missed the 8 : 30 train by five minutes .
this li@@ d is too tight for me to open .
I have to go back to work .
Mike and Ken are friends .
you don &apos;t sound too sure .
ain &apos;t that cute ?
they collected sh@@ ells on the beach .
what exactly did you say ?
he set off to Paris .
the me@@ s@@ sen@@ ger left for London in secret .
there &apos;s no way I &apos;m going to work on Sunday .
it &apos;s hard for an old man to change his way of living .
air is a mi@@ x@@ ture of various g@@ as@@ es .
Mis@@ underst@@ and@@ ings do occur .
are you going to be OK ?
what &apos;s going on with you ? you haven &apos;t been talking to me for a while now .
you don &apos;t know anything about I@@ stan@@ bu@@ l .
she only worked for the sake of money .
I don &apos;t want to talk about this anymore .
K@@ it@@ ty the cat gets in the car to go for a ride .
does this story hold water ?
M@@ ic@@ ha@@ el Jack@@ son died .
would you like to come to my party ?
the hotel is on fire .
we expected him to support us .
her behavior isn &apos;t normal for a young girl .
you didn &apos;t see nothing .
this room is too big .
these problems will be solved in the near future .
Sami &apos;s plane crashed in the field .
he doesn &apos;t want to talk about it .
I &apos;m all set .
my computer won &apos;t start any more .
I &apos;ve been in Boston for less than a month .
Tom didn &apos;t tell me he couldn &apos;t speak French .
did you find the difference between these two photos ?
it seems that the rain@@ y seas@@ on has set in .
I told you that was ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous .
what was the color of the apple he gave you ?
they survi@@ ved , even though the building was destro@@ yed .
who wants to go shopping ?
he must have been crazy to say such a thing .
my heart was p@@ oun@@ ding as my turn got near@@ er .
that &apos;s not fair ! you saw my cards in the m@@ ir@@ ror !
she was so beautiful that the mer@@ ch@@ ant &apos;s son could not help k@@ ne@@ el@@ ing down to kiss her hand .
I am laughing so that you will be happy .
if I knew you better , perhaps I would have let you in .
I want to go there once again .
I &apos;m beginning to get used to doing this .
he wrote a book about his conver@@ sion to I@@ sla@@ m .
I found it in the at@@ tic .
I don &apos;t know how to con@@ tact you .
I invited her to a movie .
Tom says it as it is .
I &apos;m sure you &apos;ll tell me what I want to know .
how is the weather there ?
a ma@@ thema@@ tical truth is neither simple nor complicated ; it is .
he is studying history at the university .
he is such a show off .
can I think about it ?
this is the fin@@ al strugg@@ le .
they &apos;re very smart .
you accused him of having stolen the bike .
why don &apos;t we talk for a while ?
I helped my parents with the hou@@ se@@ work .
he knows Mr. D@@ a@@ vi@@ d@@ son well .
get back to where you started .
that is of no use to me .
get me all the information you can on this matter .
I went to Boston by train .
maybe Tom should pay more attention in class .
you were sleeping , weren &apos;t you ?
there are no d@@ ru@@ gs here .
that &apos;s what coun@@ ts .
they &apos;ve crossed the border .
give me the mic@@ ro@@ phone .
I never thought I &apos;d see your face again .
we were playing ru@@ g@@ by .
I was born in 198@@ 2 in A@@ th@@ ens , where I still live today .
I feel much saf@@ er now .
Tom noti@@ ced Mary &apos;s hands shaking .
tomorrow , I &apos;ll take the books to the library .
you must &apos;ve been wrong .
Tom always sings in the shower .
Canadi@@ ans are our friends .
leave that box where it is .
he &apos;s got a headache .
were you born there ?
do you see a boat on the hor@@ i@@ z@@ on ?
let &apos;s decide together where to go first .
please f@@ ill out this questi@@ on@@ na@@ ire and send it to us .
I want to be alone for a while .
this skirt is ch@@ ea@@ p .
I &apos;m playing with my friends .
I think you &apos;re right .
don &apos;t ch@@ eat .
may I take your order ?
I don &apos;t understand and I &apos;m not used to not understanding . please explain it once more .
Tom drank straight from the bottle .
start at once , or you will be late .
I ordered you a drink .
they have gone far away .
he probably didn &apos;t have sex with her .
please call him up .
Hey , your dog just bit me .
I especially like your chocolate cake .
Tom is the tallest guy I &apos;ve ever seen .
you should not go alone .
that &apos;s your duty .
the doctor advised that she take a holiday .
I &apos;ve been so@@ ber for three years .
he will have no chance of winning her heart .
it &apos;s as old as the h@@ ills .
hold this .
the horse is mine .
he could swim across the river when he was in his te@@ ens .
how many kids do you have ?
look at these prices .
you &apos;re the leader .
I have little interest in history .
he studies ten hours a day on average .
I love you more and more each day .
it was surprising that she said that .
she doesn &apos;t drink .
I &apos;d like to tell you something in private .
do not inter@@ f@@ ere !
he took her in his arms .
you are lying .
are you certain that &apos;s what you want ?
I don &apos;t think I can do this anymore .
they missed the dea@@ d@@ line .
he threw the letter into the fire .
the proposal is accepted .
get your mother .
you eat good meals in this bo@@ ar@@ din@@ gh@@ ouse .
what do you have in your hand ?
I &apos;ve known about this for years .
Tom jumped back just in time .
she bought a couple of boo@@ ts .
I teach here .
were you really angry ?
she denied having met him .
stop cri@@ tici@@ zing me !
I would like to go , but I don &apos;t have a car .
he foo@@ led her .
be nice .
I &apos;m waiting for my friend .
I often sit up late at night to read .
I guess I &apos;ll have to think it over .
what &apos;s that picture inside your lo@@ ck@@ er ?
who &apos;s in command here ?
letters are deli@@ vered every day .
have you learned nothing from your mistakes ?
you &apos;ll understand it right away .
after ten years as business part@@ ners , they decided to part ways .
read as much as possible .
I have y@@ aw@@ ned .
I can &apos;t p@@ in@@ point the problem .

Tom sent Mary a lot of letters .
are you enjo@@ ying yourself ?
she had fun with him .
Tom l@@ ac@@ ks confidence in himself .
all men are equal under the law .
it &apos;s rather ir@@ on@@ ic .
I certainly have had great luck .
he woke up in the middle of the night .
you sent the p@@ ack@@ age by plane .
the meat is t@@ ough .
are you for@@ ge@@ t@@ ful ?
I had a bad stomach @-@ ache .
I &apos;ll give him your message when he comes .
Tom had no ally , but he himself was making different ene@@ mi@@ es .
their married life was full bliss .
I had a lot of help .
maybe Tom has had an accident .
I &apos;m aching to go to Australia .
your p@@ it@@ ching is far super@@ ior to mine .
I am trying to con@@ qu@@ er his heart .
I think the train will come soon .
you did what you had to do .
H@@ on@@ est@@ ly ...
do you know someone who knows about air condi@@ tion@@ ing ?
you always were a good cook .
Mary is washing her hair .
I live in B@@ i@@ a@@ ł@@ y@@ sto@@ k .
no one will survive .
this progra@@ m is brought to you by the sp@@ on@@ sors now app@@ earing on your scre@@ en .
what do they sell ?
do you prefer blon@@ des or bru@@ ne@@ ttes ?
you have no life .
she wrote him a long letter , but she didn &apos;t mail it .
she bl@@ ushed deeply .
I do not understand you .
I won &apos;t accept that .
we haven &apos;t seen you for a long time .
I have to do it by myself .
look out for pickpockets .
I have to translate the sentences .
they came back last W@@ ed@@ ne@@ s@@ day .
they didn &apos;t tell us anything .
I hate women who say that all men are the same .
I don &apos;t know why you &apos;re all so angry .
she spoke in a weak voice .
she has a large room all to herself .
it &apos;s already dark outside .
put the car@@ ro@@ ts in the pot .
I own this place .
my father died five years ago .
it &apos;s on me .
I will go if you go .
I brought you some water .
he does not like cats .
neither of them looks busy .
he disappeared without a tr@@ ace .
how do you like your new school ?
he is washing a car .
the animal in the top left @-@ hand corner is meant to be a drag@@ on .
Tom answered the teacher &apos;s questions .
you &apos;re right , no doubt about it .
you &apos;re very so@@ p@@ hi@@ st@@ ic@@ ated .
I &apos;m op@@ posed to any type of war .
he did the work on his own .
take a look at this map .
we have to seriously think about this .
he denied having written to me .
did you get enough sleep ?
several people lay w@@ ounded .
my father dri@@ ves a very old car .
the book is for me ; the flowers are for us .
please don &apos;t forget to put st@@ am@@ ps on the letters I gave you to post .
two women are singing .
we &apos;ve been told not to do that .
it turns out that you knew everything but kept quiet .
did anybody take no@@ tes ?
B@@ ol@@ lo@@ cks , where in God &apos;s name did I put my house keys ?
the accident happened at this j@@ un@@ ction .
unless you start now , you &apos;ll be late .
I &apos;ve done my job .
he is a really good wor@@ ker .
I &apos;d like to make myself useful .
it &apos;s 8 : 30 .
a storm con@@ fin@@ ed them to the house .
suddenly , the super@@ vis@@ or lost his com@@ pos@@ ure .
it was a very good experience for him .
I studied English when I was there .
I &apos;d like to hear that .
love will pre@@ va@@ il .
I got a kiss from him in respon@@ se .
I found this under your bed .
come home before six .
I might be a few minutes late .
I &apos;m not about to ask him .
everybody took a h@@ os@@ ti@@ le attitude toward illegal ali@@ ens .
I don &apos;t like to see food go to waste .
get away from me !
please be careful .
he was involved in the trouble .
the princess &apos;s taste for pleasures was ex@@ pan@@ ding ; and we thought only about how to sp@@ rin@@ k@@ le on them new seas@@ on@@ ings , so as to give them more sp@@ ice .
I forgot to do something .
Tom and Mary are both very hungry .
you &apos;re going in the wrong direction .
Tom was fired .
she beg@@ ged me to go with her .
watch me do it !
I want this letter opened now .
go warm up .
I &apos;m assu@@ ming this is your father .
he became disp@@ ir@@ ited .

act@@ ors , arti@@ sts , mus@@ ici@@ ans , and writ@@ ers may use many forms inclu@@ ding spoken and written words , ac@@ tions , col@@ ors and sounds .
Tom and his children spent all afternoon looking for the perfect Christmas tree .
you &apos;re probably tired .
three four@@ ths of the earth &apos;s surface is covered with water .
there wasn &apos;t even one book in the room .
you were jealous .
they rescued him from danger .
leave your umbrella in the hall .
I am single .
I will make you happy .
we &apos;ll work together .
Sami &apos;s a wa@@ iter at a gay bar .
I know that boy who is running .
one ro@@ ll of color film , please .
the great@@ er the difference between the nu@@ ll hypothesis and an out@@ come , and the larger the sa@@ mple size , the more confi@@ dent one can be that the out@@ come is mean@@ ing@@ ful .
let &apos;s see who can finish doing this first .
I think you might be over@@ re@@ acting .
where do you want to eat ?
if I knew how to use a computer , maybe they would pay me more .
beautiful bird !
you can &apos;t do both at the same time .
I had to make a choice .
they were stupid not to follow your advice .
I forgot to bring my I@@ .@@ D@@ . card .
do you want to know my secret ? it &apos;s very simple ...
you need a drink .
I don &apos;t like sil@@ ence .
I was asked to wait here .
I want to write an article .
Tom is a player .
why so g@@ lu@@ m ?
a cold kept him in bed .
what would you like me to do ?
Tom said that Mary looked exhausted .
she may have missed the train .
I didn &apos;t say I wasn &apos;t free .
illness can often occur at a very in@@ con@@ ven@@ ient time .
are you with the F@@ B@@ I ?
I worry about your health .
I should have guessed .
I have very good ey@@ es@@ ight .
Tom said that it probably wouldn &apos;t rain until evening .
keep foc@@ used on your work .
I can &apos;t be seen with you .
the floor must be kept clean .
the building col@@ lap@@ sed in the earthquake .
their los@@ ses reached one milli@@ on yen .
old tra@@ ins have their char@@ m .
we were all shaking from the bitter cold .
rubbish !
we don &apos;t give a fuck .
it must &apos;ve been extremely painful .
J@@ ill says that she &apos;s happ@@ ily married , but at times you &apos;d never know it .
I am American .
my time is very expensive .
I was dis@@ ma@@ yed at the news .
you &apos;re very open .
she tried to persuade him to buy her a p@@ ear@@ l ne@@ ck@@ l@@ ace .
I actually am 8@@ 1 years old but if I sub@@ tr@@ act the time I &apos;ve waited to get my bags at the airport , I &apos;m only 4@@ 3 .
they &apos;re ignor@@ ing me .
I want you to stay here with her .
Sami is really un@@ lucky when it comes to women .
please give my regar@@ ds to your father .
no mechan@@ ical problems were found .
this is not good at all .
your garden needs some attention .
he felt in his pocket for his ligh@@ ter .
what &apos;re you doing today ?
you &apos;re part of the problem .
I was hoping that you &apos;d know the answer .
Sami is a compu@@ l@@ sive liar .
he wants to kill me .
the baby is sleeping .
what do you like about her ?
I &apos;m not here to buy shoes .
you &apos;ll have to do that on your own .
did anybody see you ?
how does he think it went ?
let &apos;s be careful .
the students were ill at ease before the exam .
push the door open .
who list@@ ens to Tom ?
do you know anyone who &apos;s not on F@@ ace@@ book ?
how much does an egg cost ?
that &apos;s why I &apos;m here .
nobody answered the door .
it &apos;s hard to get a taxi outside the station .
she made mistake after mistake .
these mot@@ or@@ cy@@ cles are the same type .
according to the paper , there was a big fire in Boston .
everyone looked relieved .
S@@ tre@@ t@@ ch your arms straight .
you can &apos;t have both .
there &apos;s nothing up here .
how is the word pron@@ oun@@ ced ?
our cat is ster@@ i@@ li@@ zed .
I know that Tom isn &apos;t rich .
something tells me that you &apos;re hiding something .
she made me wait for half an hour .
you gave me your word .
they began this year .
what &apos;s the worst tattoo you &apos;ve ever seen ?
can I get something to eat ?
you can &apos;t complain .
if I knew you better , perhaps I would have let you in .
if you want that , you can have it .
our ow@@ ner@@ ship in the company is 60 % .
we don &apos;t do this often enough .
we &apos;re not poor .
I &apos;m kind of busy right now , Tom .
I was born here .
my hands are ti@@ ed .
listen carefully .
